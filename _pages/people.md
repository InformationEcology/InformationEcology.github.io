My research focuses on the chemical ecology and plant-insect interactions. I study the patterns and aim to understand the underlying processes of plant-insect communication in various habitats (e.g., Alpine grassland, tropical/subtropical forests, agricultural fields). I hope to bring new insights on plant-insect network and further contribute to biodiversity conservation and restoration practices.
