I am interested in understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes of the chemical communication between plants and insects by integrating concepts from biology, chemistry and information theory.

My research focuses on the chemical ecology of plant-insect interactions. By deciphering the chemical communication substances between plants at different altitudes and different functional groups of insects in various habitats, understand the chemical communication mechanism between plants and insects, to achieve the purpose of biodiversity conservation and restoration practices.
